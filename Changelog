1.2.0 - 02/12/2002
------------------
- Compatibility between older versions has been broken!
- Server now sends client IV and timestamp, fixing
  encryption problems and making it more resistant
  to "replay" attacks (Ralf Ertzinger)
- Random IV is now seeded from /dev/urandom instead
  of time() if possible
- Added directions on running under xinetd to README
- Implemented Beej's sendall() to handle incomplete send()s
- Added single-mode daemon code (David Luyer)
- Fixed problem with aggregated writes (David Luyer)
- Better autoconf detection of libmcrypt (Jay McCarthy)
- Added ability to dump check results to alternate
  dump file if command file does not exist (i.e. NetSaint
  is not running)

------------------
- Added append_to_file option to allow for opening the
  command file in either write or append mode
- Explicit integer size in packet structure
- NULL IV is used for both encryption/decryption.  This
  leaves the daemon open to "replay" attacks, but will
  disappear in future revisions when IV negotiation
  between the client and daemon is implemented.
