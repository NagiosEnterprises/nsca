NSCA Tests
==========
Originally contributed by Ton Voon/Altinity 01/26/2007.

These tests are designed to make sure that the Nagios daemon can start up
and accept messages by comparing the output in the dummy nagios.cmd file with
the sent data.

There are 3 tests at the moment:

    * basic - just sends a few passive checks and makes sure that the nagios.cmd file receives them

    * multiple - runs the same as basic, but several times to check the daemon can handle multiple requests

    * simultaneous - runs lots of send_nscas at the same time (well, nearly). Uses Parallel::Forker to setup all the sends then executes them all at once. Expect about 200 extra processes to hit your server!


Requirements
------------
You will need to have the following CPAN modules installed:

Test::More
Class::Struct
Clone
Parallel::Forker


Running the Tests
-----------------
1. Run the NSCA configure script and compile the NSCA binaries

2. Run the tests from this directory by running the following command:

	./runtests
